🌧️ Tushauriane – Mental Health Support for Flood Victims
💡 Overview
Tushauriane (Swahili for “Let’s Talk”) is an online mental health platform built to support flood victims in Kenya—especially those in rural and underserved areas. The project was inspired by the urgent need for emotional and psychological support during and after natural disasters like floods, which have not only destroyed homes and infrastructure but also deeply affected the mental well-being of thousands.

This web-based solution offers free, accessible, and culturally relevant mental health resources tailored to help individuals cope and build resilience during crises.
